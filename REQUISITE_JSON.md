    "level": Level | null,
    "subject": Subject | null,
}
```

## Consent

Accepts an object as the consenter, return `boolean`.

# Properties

## Course

Defines a course, of type `string`. It is usually starts with four capital-letter subject code and followed by a three-digit course number.

## Faculty

Defines a faculty, which is an enum of all the faculty codes.

```

{ "faculty": string }

```

## Department

Defines a department, which is an enum of all the department codes.

```

{ "department": string }

```

## Program

Defines a program.

```

{
    "program": string | null,
    "faculty": Faculty | null,
    "department": Department | null,
    "honours": boolean | null,
    "type": "major" | "minor" | "concentration" | null,
    "degree": string,
    "career": "undergraduate" | "graduate" | "doctoral" | null
    "year": Year | null
    "gpa": number | null
}

```

## Level

Defines the level of a course. The level is ranging from 10 to 700.
When the level is represented in a pure number, it is the exact level that the course must satisfy.
When the level is represented in a pure number followed by a `+`, it is the minimum level that the course must satisfy.

## Subject
